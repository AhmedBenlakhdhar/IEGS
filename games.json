Moderate risks stem from significant positive portrayal of Norse paganism, characters interacting with god-like beings (Isu), depictions of effective seer visions, frequent optional romances and some revealing outfits, game design encouraging lengthy playtime via vast world and collectibles, normalized character arrogance and Viking bravado, central portrayal of alcohol consumption including drinking mini-games, incentivized raiding of settlements sometimes including non-combatants, and impactful microtransactions offering gear and boosters. Mild risks include historical Islamic references (Abbasid Caliphate), optional gambling (Orlog dice game), optional lying in dialogue, background music, fantasy abilities presented as Isu tech or myth, occasional profanity, mild horror elements, and themes of fate.",

Mild risks include background music, time waste in a large world, fantasy violence, mild horror, despair themes, and DLC spending.",
