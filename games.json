Features severe risks from actively promoting deviant ideologies, particularly surrounding LGBTQ+ relationships presented centrally and positively as core character identities and plot points. Severe risks also from pervasive, graphic, and often sadistic violence against humans depicted realistically and required for progression. Severe risks from dominant, persistent themes of despair, nihilism, and the cycle of violence, potentially leaving players with a strong negative or hopeless feeling. Moderate concerns involve frequent strong profanity normalized in dialogue, and intense horror elements (infected creatures, tense encounters). Mild risks include background music, potential time waste, and character arrogance/ruthlessness.",

Contains extremely graphic, brutal, and often sadistic violence required to progress. The narrative is overwhelmingly bleak, focusing on revenge, despair, and nihilism (Severe Despair). Includes frequent strong profanity and intense horror. Avoidance is necessary due to promotion of impermissible lifestyles, extreme violence, and deeply negative themes.</p>",
