    {# --- Introduction --- #}
    <h2 class="mt-4">1. {% translate "Introduction & Purpose" %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}The Muslim Game Classification (MGC) system provides structured guidance for Muslims seeking to evaluate video games according to Islamic principles. Its primary purpose is to enable users to make informed decisions about game engagement, aligning their choices with the teachings of the Quran, the authentic Sunnah (Prophetic tradition), and the understanding of the As-Salaf As-Salih (Pious Predecessors).{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}This document outlines the methodology used by MGC assessors to analyze games and assign ratings, ensuring consistency, transparency, and adherence to core Islamic values.{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

    {# --- Core Principles --- #}
    <h2 class="mt-4">2. {% translate "Core Principles" %}</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>{% translate "Foundation:" %}</strong> {% blocktranslate %}All assessments are grounded in the Quran and the authentic Sunnah, interpreted according to the understanding and consensus of the As-Salaf As-Salih. Where matters require <em>ijtihad</em> (scholarly reasoning), established principles of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), such as <em>Maqasid al-Shari'ah</em> (Objectives of Islamic Law) and <em>Sadd al-Dhara'i</em> (Blocking the Means to Evil), are applied.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li><strong>{% translate "Objectivity & Consistency:" %}</strong> {% blocktranslate %}Assessors strive for objective analysis based on demonstrable game content and mechanics, applying the criteria consistently across all titles.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li><strong>{% translate "Scope:" %}</strong> {% blocktranslate %}The primary focus is the game's content, themes, mechanics, required player actions, and potential impact (including normalization of values). Player behavior is generally outside the scope, unless directly necessitated or heavily incentivized by the game design.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li><strong>{% translate "Caution & Avoiding Doubt:" %}</strong> {% blocktranslate %}In cases of ambiguity or differing scholarly opinions on minor matters, a cautious approach is favored, often reflected in a 'Mashbouh' rating or detailed notes.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li><strong>{% translate "Transparency:" %}</strong> {% blocktranslate %}The methodology aims for clarity. Justifications for ratings, especially the severity levels and overall tier, are documented and made accessible where appropriate.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    </ul>

    {# --- Rating Process --- #}
    <h2 class="mt-4">3. {% translate "The MGC Rating Process" %}</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Game Selection & Initial Review:</strong> Games are chosen based on factors like popularity, community requests, or potential Islamic relevance. An initial playthrough and research identify key themes and potential areas requiring detailed analysis.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Detailed Content Analysis:</strong> The game is systematically evaluated against the <strong>MGC Breakdown Categories</strong> (Section 4). For each category, a <strong>Severity Level</strong> is assigned based on specific criteria (Section 5), documenting concrete examples (<code>_details</code>) and reasoning (<code>_reason</code>). Both direct simulation/engagement and normalization/promotion aspects are considered.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Assessment of Positive Aspects:</strong> Assessors identify and document any noteworthy positive or beneficial elements within the game (Section 8.4).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Overall Tier Determination:</strong> Based on the highest severity levels reached (especially in critical categories like Aqidah), the pervasiveness of problematic content, and the balance of concerns (considering normalization risks), the <strong>Overall MGC Rating Tier</strong> (Halal, Mashbouh, Haram, Kufr) is assigned according to the logic in Section 6.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Assigning Supporting Elements:</strong> Relevant <strong>Content Flags</strong> are selected, the <strong>Requires Adjustment</strong> status is determined (and <code>adjustment_guide</code> filled if True), <strong>Suitability Notes</strong> are added, and the <strong>Is Recommended</strong> status is set where applicable (Section 8).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Rationale & Documentation:</strong> The overall reasoning is summarized in the <code>rationale</code> field. Key assessor information (<code>rated_by</code>, <code>rating_date</code>) is recorded.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Review & Publication:</strong> Ratings undergo an internal review for consistency and accuracy before being published on the MGC platform. Ratings may be updated following significant game changes or new insights.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    </ol>

     {# --- Breakdown Categories --- #}
    <h2 class="mt-4">4. {% translate "MGC Breakdown Categories" %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}Each game is analyzed across these key areas of potential Islamic concern:{% endblocktranslate %}</p>
    <ul>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Aqidah & Ideology:</strong> Content related to core Islamic beliefs (Tawhid), Shirk (polytheism), Kufr (disbelief), magic (Sihr), veneration of false deities, blasphemy, atheism (Ilhad), problematic ideologies, or distortion of Islamic tenets.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Violence & Aggression:</strong> Depiction and context of violence, gore, brutality, killing, torture, and promotion of aggression.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Immorality & Indecency:</strong> Content related to Zina (unlawful intercourse), Liwat (sodomy), exposure of 'Awrah (nudity/improper attire), Tabarruj (immodest display), promotion of impermissible relationships/lifestyles, Ikhtilat (casual free-mixing between unrelated genders), foul language (Fahisha), slander (Qadhf), backbiting (Ghibah), and general promotion of Fisq (open sinfulness).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Haram Substances & Gambling:</strong> Depiction, use, promotion, or normalization of Khamr (intoxicants), drugs, or mechanics involving Maysir/Qimar (gambling).{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Audio & Music:</strong> Presence and nature of background music (Ma'azif), lyrical content (Ghina'), sound effects, and the ability to mute audio elements. Considers potential impermissibility based on instrumentation, themes, or association.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Time Commitment & Addiction Potential:</strong> Analysis of gameplay loops, time investment required, potential for Israf (wastefulness) of time, and mechanics designed to be addictive, potentially leading to neglect of religious or worldly duties.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
        <li>{% blocktranslate %}<strong>Online Conduct & Interaction:</strong> Risks associated with online multiplayer features, including exposure to Fitnah, Laghw (idle talk), toxic behavior, poor moderation, and potential for inappropriate interactions.{% endblocktranslate %}</li>
    </ul>

     {# --- Severity Levels --- #}
    <h2 class="mt-4">5. {% translate "Severity Level Definitions" %}</h2>
    <p>{% blocktranslate %}For each Breakdown Category, a severity level is assigned:{% endblocktranslate %}</p>

        <dd class="col-sm-10">{% blocktranslate %}Severe concerns. May involve strong encouragement/reward for problematic actions (short of major sins/Kufr), significant difficulty avoiding Haram elements, OR active, positive <em>promotion or normalization</em> of impermissible lifestyles/beliefs (short of Kufr/Shirk) or major sins, making negative influence or <em>Tashabbuh</em> likely.{% endblocktranslate %}</dd>
